# Problem Activity 3:
# Write a program to give a studentâ€™s final grade in a course with the following grading
# scheme: there are two quizzes worth 100 points each, a midterm worth 100 points, and a
# final exam worth 100 points. 
# 
# The grade is based on the following weights: 
# 50% on the final exam, 
# 25 % on the midterm,
# and 25% on the quiz average. 
# 
# The grade is determined from
# the weighted in the traditional way: 
# 90 or over is an A, 
# below 90 down to 80 is a B, 
# below 80 down to 70 is a C, 
# below 70 down to 60 is D, 
# and below 60 is an F. 
# 
# The passing character
# grade is a C. Display a remark if it Passed or Failed.
